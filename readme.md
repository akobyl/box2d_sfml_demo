# SFML and Box2D Demo

This is a quick demo of using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) in a single project. It drops a ball so realistically you think it is a real video.

To "push" the ball click with the left mouse button.

The right mouse button sets the ball position under the cursor.


## Building

CMake is required.  Create a `build` directory and run `cmake ..` from there.  Then run `cmake --build .` to build the project.
